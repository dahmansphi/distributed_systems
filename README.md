# Book TWO- Analysis From the start to the end

## Book Cover

> You can have full access to the material of this book from the [outlet](#outlets) section below. Thank you.

## The Content

This is the second element of **the Big Bang of Data Science**, **`Analysis from the Start to The End`**.  
I donâ€™t want to stick to that _abstract and direct_ definition from the academic book, on the meaning of analysis, but from the industrial one. So, I believe **ANALYSIS** is the _co-concertmaster_ that sits in the second chair of the highest leadership position among all the other parts that are responsible for the outcome of a product.
